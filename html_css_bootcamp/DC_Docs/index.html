                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. 
                On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic 
                Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird 
                enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty seven times in various disguises.

                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, 
                the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, ". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . 
                half an inch, if that . . ." 
                "Hello, Nick," said Harry. 
    
                <p>"Hello, hello," said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, 
                which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and 
                torrential rain outside. </p>
    
                <h4>Campus Info</h4>
                "Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for 
                Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore."
